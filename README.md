# Summary of Three Reinforcement Learning Methods

## 1. PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

### Core Equation - Clipped Objective:
```
L^CLIP(θ) = E[min(r_t(θ)Â_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)Â_t)]
```

**Where:**
- `r_t(θ) = π_θ(a_t|s_t) / π_θ_old(a_t|s_t)` (probability ratio)
- `Â_t` = advantage estimate
- `ε` = clip parameter (typically 0.2)

### Key Features:
- **Three-stage process**: Supervised fine-tuning → Reward model training → RL optimization  
- **Value function**: Uses critic network to estimate V(s) for advantage computation
- **Advantage**: `A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s) = r + γV(s') - V(s)`
- **Stability**: Clipping prevents destructive policy updates

## 2. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)

### Core Equation - Direct Optimization:
```
L_DPO(π_θ) = -E[(log σ(β log π_θ(y_w|x)/π_ref(y_w|x) - β log π_θ(y_l|x)/π_ref(y_l|x)))]
```

**Where:**
- `y_w` = preferred response
- `y_l` = rejected response  
- `β` = temperature parameter controlling deviation from reference
- `σ` = sigmoid function

### Key Features:
- **Single-stage process**: Direct optimization on preference data
- **No reward model**: Implicitly learns rewards through preference classification
- **No value function**: Treats alignment as supervised learning problem
- **Simplicity**: Much simpler pipeline than PPO

## 3. GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

### Core Equation - Group-Based Advantage:
```
A_i = R_i - (1/|G|) Σ_{j∈G} R_j
```

**Where:**
- `A_i` = advantage for response i
- `R_i` = reward for response i
- `G` = group of similar responses
- `|G|` = group size

### Optimization Objective:
```
L_GRPO = E[A_i * log π_θ(a_i|s_i)] - λ * KL(π_θ || π_ref)
```

### Key Features:
- **No value function**: Uses group mean as baseline instead of learned V(s)
- **Group sampling**: Generates multiple responses per prompt for comparison
- **Memory efficient**: ~40% less memory than PPO (no critic network)
- **Reasoning focused**: Particularly effective for mathematical/logical tasks

## Quick Comparison Summary

| Method | **Equation Focus** | **Stages** | **Memory** | **Best For** |
|--------|-------------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **PPO** | Clipped probability ratios + Value function | 3 | Highest | General chat, proven reliability |
| **DPO** | Direct preference classification | 1 | Lowest | Simple alignment, resource constraints |
| **GRPO** | Group-relative advantages | 2 | Medium | Mathematical reasoning, efficiency |

## The Evolution Timeline

**PPO** (complex but proven) → **DPO** (simple but limited) → **GRPO** (efficient for reasoning)

Each method represents different trade-offs between complexity, efficiency, and specialized performance!

## Mathematical Intuition

### PPO Philosophy:
> "Don't change the policy too much at once, and use a learned baseline to reduce noise"

### DPO Philosophy:
> "Skip the reward model - directly learn what humans prefer"

### GRPO Philosophy:
> "Compare responses within groups - the group average is your baseline"
